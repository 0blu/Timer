**General Info**

* The plugin is based on Alongub's [Timer 1.0.7] (https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=189751).
* It is completely modular and extensible (private addons can be requested, just PN me).
* It measures the time and jumps it takes players to finish the map.
* Players can choose their level of difficulty (style). 
* You can add up to 32 styles, and change their physical effects on the player (timer-physics) and much other stuff.
* It has an advanced world record system. There are also other stats available
* A map start and end is determined by map zones. You can add map zones in-game ([video] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAX7FAF_N8Q)). 
* There are also glitch map zones, that try to stop players from exploiting map bugs that can possibly be used to cheat the timer (~ zones types).
* It has a customizable HUD that displays players their current timer and other info (or if you're a spectator it displays the timer of the player you're spectating).
* It has a Chatrank system which is based on a points-system.
* It supports only MySQL and is almost threaded.
* It supports CS:S and CS:GO (not all features are working on CS:GO).
* PHP-Stats (Lite) to show top players/maps on your website
* You can also use custom sprites for zone beam effects ([video tutorial] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uka1Iq_I6W4&feature=youtu.be)).
* There are also many other optional modules.
